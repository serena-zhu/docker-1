# Launch a shell from an alpine container, and make sure that you can interact
# directly with the container via your terminal, and that the container deletes itself
# once the shellâ€™s execution is done.

docker run -it --rm alpine /bin/ash

# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35689628/starting-a-shell-in-the-docker-alpine-container
# /bin/ash is Ash (Almquist Shell) provided by BusyBox
# --rm Automatically remove the container when it exits (docker run --help)
# -i Interactive mode (Keep STDIN open even if not attached)
# -t Allocate a pseudo-TTY
# Usually, an Alpine Linux image doesn't contain bash, Instead you can use /bin/ash, /bin/sh, ash or only sh.
