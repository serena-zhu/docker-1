# From the shell of a debian container, install via the container’s package manager
# everything you need to compile C source code and push it onto a git repo (of
# course, make sure before that the package manager and the packages already in the
# container are updated). For this exercise, you should only specify the commands
# to be run directly in the container.


# To launch debian container: 
#docker run -it --rm debian /bin/bash

apt-get update && apt-get install -y git-core && apt-get install -y build-essential && apt-get install -y vim
