# Launch a container name Abathur. It will be a Python container, 2-slim version,
# its /root folder will be bound to a HOME folder on your host, and its 3000 port
# will be bound to the 3000 port of your virtual machine.
# You will personalize this container so that you can use the Flask micro-framework
# in its latest version. You will make sure that an html page displaying "Hello World"
# with <h1> tags can be served by Flask. You will test that your container is
# properly set up by accessing, via curl or a web browser, the IP address of your
# virtual machine on the 3000 port.
# You will also list all the necessary commands in your repository.

docker run --name Abathur -p 3000:3000 -v /home:/root -it -d python:2-slim
docker exec -it Abathur bash
pip install Flask
