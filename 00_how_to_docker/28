# Damn it, a group of zergs is attacking orbital-command, and shutting down
# the engineering-bay service won’t help at all... You must send a troup of Marines
# to eliminate the intruders. Launch a 42school/marine-squad in two replicas,
# and make sure that the service works properly (see the documentation provided
# at hub.docker.com). This service will be named... marines and will be on the
# overmind network.

docker service create --name marines --network overmind --replicas 2 -e OC_USERNAME=serena -e OC_PASSWD=123456 42school/marine-squad
